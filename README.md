# SEOZEO-TEST

Hello,

This is a simple test project for Zeo's job application.

**It has only one php file and it's the project's index.php. Other files are cascade style files, images and Javascripts.** 
**I did my tests in localhost, with XAMPP. (Apache and MySQL). MySQL console panel is PhpMyAdmin(XAMPP's default.)**

**You can find zeotest.sql file in master branch. If you have XAMPP installed, take this project to the xampp > htdocs and in PhpMyAdmin import our "zeotest.sql" file**.
